# static-gzip

Middleware for [Connect](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/) or [Express](http://expressjs.com/) that compresses static files using gzip and caches the result on disk for use in future requests.

Based on [connect-gzip](https://github.com/tikonen/connect-gzip).


## Installation

Install via npm:

    $ npm install static-gzip


## Usage

### staticGzip(root, [options])

Gzips files in a root directory, and then serves them using the [send](https://github.com/pillarjs/send) middleware.

If a file under the root path (such as an image) does not have an appropriate MIME type for compression, it will still be passed through to `send` and served uncompressed. Thus, you can simply use `staticGzip` in place of `connect.static` or `express.static`.

    var connect = require('connect'),
        staticGzip = require('static-gzip');
    
    connect.createServer(
      staticGzip(__dirname + '/public')
    ).listen(3000);
    
    
    // Only gzip javascript files:
    staticGzip(__dirname + '/public', { matchType: /javascript/ })

    // Set a maxAge in milliseconds for browsers to cache files
    var oneDay = 86400000;
    staticGzip(__dirname + '/public', { maxAge: oneDay })

    // Store all gzipped files in a directory called 'public-gzip'
    staticGzip(__dirname + '/public', { gzipRoot: __dirname + '/public-gzip' })

Options:

- `matchType` - A regular expression tested against the file MIME type to determine whether the response should be gzipped or not. As in `connect.static`, MIME types are determined based on file extensions using [node-mime](https://github.com/bentomas/node-mime). The default value is `/text|javascript|json/`.
- `maxAge` - Maximum time in milliseconds for browsers to cache files.
- `gzipRoot` - Root directory for cached gzip files. Defaults to root if not specified.
